\arguments{
\item{rt}{a vector of RTs. Or for convenience also a \code{data.frame} with columns \code{rt} and \code{response} (such as returned from \code{rdiffusion} or \code{\link{rLBA}}). See examples.}

\item{response}{character vector. Which response boundary should be tested? Possible values are \code{c("upper", "lower")}, possibly abbreviated and \code{"upper"} being the default. Alternatively, a numeric vector with values 1=lower and 2=upper. For convenience, \code{response} is converted via \code{as.numeric} also allowing factors (see examples). Ignored if the first argument is a \code{data.frame}.}

\item{a}{threshold separation. Amount of information that is considered for a decision. Large values indicate a conservative decisional style. Typical range: 0.5 < \code{a} < 2}

\item{v}{drift rate. Average slope of the information accumulation process. The drift gives information about the speed and direction of the accumulation of information. Large (absolute) values of drift indicate a good performance. If received information supports the response linked to the upper threshold the sign will be positive and vice versa. Typical range: -5 < \code{v} < 5}

\item{t0}{non-decision time or response time constant (in seconds). Lower bound for the duration of all non-decisional processes (encoding and response execution). Typical range: 0.1 < \code{t0} < 0.5}

\item{z}{relative starting point. Indicator of an a priori bias in decision making. When the relative starting point \code{z} deviates from 0.5, the amount of information necessary for a decision differs between response alternatives. Typical range: 0.3 < \code{z} < 0.7. Default is 0.5 (i.e., no bias).}

\item{d}{differences in speed of response execution (in seconds). Positive values indicate that response execution is faster for responses linked to the upper threshold than for responses linked to the lower threshold. Typical range: -0.1 < \code{d} < 0.1. Default is 0.}

\item{sz}{inter-trial-variability of (relative) starting point. Range of a uniform distribution with mean \code{z} describing the distribution of actual starting points from specific trials. Minimal impact on the RT distributions, values different from 0 can predict slow errors. Can be fixed to 0 in most applications. Typical range: 0 < \code{sz} < 0.5. Default is 0.}

\item{sv}{inter-trial-variability of drift rate. Standard deviation of a normal distribution with mean \code{v} describing the distribution of actual drift rates from specific trials. Minimal impact on the RT distributions, values different from 0 can predict fast errors. Can be fixed to 0 in most applications. Typical range: 0 < \code{sv} < 2. Default is 0.}

\item{st0}{inter-trial-variability of non-decisional components. Range of a uniform distribution with mean \code{t0 + st0/2} describing the distribution of actual \code{t0} values across trials. Accounts for response times below \code{t0}. Reduces skew of predicted RT distributions. Can be fixed to 0 in most applications. Typical range: 0 < \code{st0} < 0.2. Default is 0.}

\item{s}{diffusion constant; standard deviation of the random noise of the diffusion process (i.e., within-trial variability), scales \code{a}, \code{v}, and \code{sv}. Needs to be fixed to a constant in most applications. Default is 1. Note that the default used by Ratcliff and in other applications is often 0.1.}

\item{precision}{\code{numerical} scalar value. Precision of calculation. Corresponds roughly to the number of decimals of the predicted CDFs that are calculated accurately. Default is 3.}

\item{maxt}{maximum \code{rt} allowed, used to stop integration problems (\code{prd} only).}

\item{p}{vector of probabilities. Or for convenience also a \code{data.frame} with columns \code{p} and \code{response}. See examples.}

\item{interval}{a vector containing the end-points of the interval to be searched for the desired quantiles (i.e., RTs) in \code{qdiffusion}. Default is \code{c(0, 10)}.}

\item{n}{is a desired number of observations.}
}
\value{
\code{ddiffusion} gives the density, \code{pdiffusion} gives the distribution function, \code{qdiffusion} gives the quantile function (i.e., predicted RTs), and \code{rdiffusion} generates random response times and decisions (returning a \code{data.frame} with columns \code{rt} (numeric) and \code{response} (factor)).

The length of the result is determined by \code{n} for \code{rrd}, and is equal to the length of \code{rt} for \code{drd} and \code{prd}.

The distribution parameters (as well as \code{response}) are recycled to the length of the result. In other words, the functions are completely vectorized for all parameters and even the response boundary.

\description{
Density, distribution function, quantile function, and random generation for the Ratcliff diffusion model with following parameters: \code{a} (threshold separation), \code{z} (\emph{relative} starting point), \code{v} (drift rate), \code{t0} (non-decision time/response time constant), \code{d} (differences in speed of response execution), \code{sv} (inter-trial-variability of drift), \code{st0} (inter-trial-variability of non-decisional components), \code{sz} (inter-trial-variability of relative starting point), and \code{s} (diffusion constant). \strong{Note that the parameterization or defaults of start point \code{z}, non-decision time variability \code{st0}, and diffusion constant \code{s} differ from what is often found in the literature.}
}
\details{
The Ratcliff diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) is a mathematical model for two-choice discrimination tasks. It is based on the assumption that information is accumulated continuously until one of two decision thresholds is hit. For more information, see Voss, Rothermund, and Voss (2004), Voss, Nagler, and Lerche (2013), or Wagenmakers (2009).

All functions are fully vectorized across all parameters as well as the response. This allows for trialwise parameters for each parameter. 

For convenience, all functions (with the exception of \code{rdiffusion}) allow that the first argument is a \code{data.frame} containing the information of the first and second argument in two columns (i.e., \code{rt}/\code{p} and \code{response}). Other columns will be ignored. This allows, for example, to pass the \code{data.frame} generated by \code{rdiffusion} directly to \code{pdiffusion}. See examples.

\subsection{Distribution Function (CDF)}{
For the time being, the cumulative probability function (\code{pdiffusion}) uses numerical integration of \code{ddiffusion} via \code{\link{integral}} from package \pkg{pracma}. While this is somewhat slow, it reliably produces correct results. Any problems in the numerical integration is passed on as a warning.
}

\subsection{Quantile Function}{
Due to the bivariate nature of the diffusion model, the diffusion processes reaching each response boundary only return the defective CDF that does not reach 1. Only the sum of the CDF for both boundaries reaches 1. Therefore, \code{qdiffusion} can only return quantiles/RTs for any accumulator up to the maximal probability of that accumulator's CDF. This can be obtained by evaluating the CDF at a high value or \code{Inf} (the latter can be slow). See examples. 

Also note that quantiles (i.e., predicted RTs) are obtained by numerically minimizing the absolute difference between desired probability and the value returned from \code{pdiffusion} using \code{\link{optimize}}. If the difference between the desired probability and probability corresponding to the returned quantile is above a certain threshold (currently 0.0001) no quantile is returned but \code{NA}. This can be either because the desired quantile is above the maximal probability for this accumulator or because the limits for the numerical integration are too small (default is \code{c(0, 10)}).
}
}
\note{
The start point \code{z} is the relative start point and \emph{not} the absolute start point. 

The parameterization of the non-decisional components, \code{t0} and \code{st0}, differs from the parameterization used by, for example, Andreas Voss or Roger Ratcliff in that \code{t0} is \emph{not} the lower bound of the uniform distribution of length \code{st0}, but its midpoint.

The default diffusion constant \code{s} is 1 and not 0.1 as in most applications of Roger Ratcliff and others.

RTs need to be sorted (in increasing order) for \code{pdiffusion}.
