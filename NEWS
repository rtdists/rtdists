Changes to Version 0.5-x (released May 2016)

    o Calculation of the CDF for the diffusion model was incorrect (this bug was
      present in all prior versions of rtdists). pdiffusion now simply 
      integrates the PDF to obtain the CDF using R's integrate.
    
    o Added rr98 data set: Experiment 1 from Ratcliff and Rouder (1998, 
      Psych. Science). We thank Roger Ratcliff and Jeff Rouder for providing the
      data.
      
    o Added vignette showing how to analyze the data from Ratcliff and Rouder 
      (1998) with both diffusion and LBA model.
      
    o Quantile functions work more robust and try uniroot if optimize does not 
      converge.
      

Changes to Version 0.4-x (released April 2016)

    o Added dLBA(), pLBA(), qLBA(), and rLBA().
      dLBA() is a fully vectorized versions of n1PDF which has response as
      second argument, allowing to get the density for each response and 
      corresponding response time in one step. As for the diffusion model 
      (see below), this allows a likelihood function which only includes one 
      call to the density function. pLBA() and qLBA() are the correpsonding CDF 
      and quantile functions, respectively. rLBA() is a fully vectorized version 
      of the RNG functions and should be used from now on as top-level function.
      
    o t0 in the LBA now accepts accumulator and trialwise parameters just as A 
      and b. st0 now accepts trialwise parameter (not accumulator wise).
  
    o Diffusion model function have been renamed to ddiffusion, pdiffusion, 
      and rdiffusion. Added quantile function for diffusion model, qdiffusion.
    
    o Diffusion model functions are now completely vectorized and accept 
      vectors as parameters (including for boundary). As for the LBA, this 
      allows a likelihood function which only includes one call to the density
      function (see examples). 
      
    o Boundary parameter for diffusion functions accept numeric/factor vectors.
      
    o t0 in the diffusion model now corresponds to the lower bound of the 
      uniform distribution from which t0 is drawn (it was the mean before). 
      The specifications of t0 now agree between LBA and diffusion model. 
      
    o Density for diffusion model is now always positive.
    
    o First argument in most functions (vector of response times) renamed to rt
      (was t before).
      
    o PDF and CDF LBA functions more robust (now mostly return 0 instead of NaN)
      for problematic parameter values (such as A = 0) [2015-09-17].
