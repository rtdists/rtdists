This software (the RCppFastDM portion of the rtdists package) is, to a very
substantial degree, a derivative work of the fast-dm 30.2 software by:

Jochen Voss <voss@seehuhn.de>
Andreas Voss <andreas.voss@psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de>

Which is available from:

http://www.psychologie.uni-heidelberg.de/ae/meth/fast-dm/

And is described in the following papers:

Voss, A., Voss, J., 2008. A fast numerical algorithm for the estimation
  of diffusion-model parameters. Journal of Mathematiocal Psychology.

Voss, A., Voss, J., 2007. Fast-dm: A free program for efficient diffusion model
  analysis.  Behavioral Research Methods, 39, 767-775.

RCppFastDM, by Matthew Gretton <matthew.gretton@utas.edu.au>, modifies and
encapsulates the core PDF, CDF and random sampling implementations of fast-dm
into an RCpp library capable of being compiled via a C++ compiler and invoked
via the R programming language.
